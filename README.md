# 22.07SDE5-MANDATORY OVERTIME-T3-Capstone
## Introduction
It's friday afternoon and a young developer has had a long week at the office.
The developer's thought is filled with the rooftop halloween party happening later that night, and the developer looks forward to attending the party after a stressful week.
However, the developer has been stuck with the same error in a code for about two weeks and quickly snaps back reality.
While working on the code, a coworker stops by and informs the developer about a Mandatory Overtime rumor. Knowing that any extra time spent at work that day 
would affect their plans for the night, the developer decides to round up work for the day and leave the work building without being spotted by their manager.
